Neuromancer was the book that initiated the cyberpunk debate, which was very influential in culture studies. The paper explores Gibson's position towards the mind-body-problem, i.e. the relation between mind and body., abstract: This paper is about William Gibson's famous novel \"Neuromancer.\" Neuromancer was the book that initiated the cyberpunk debate, a debate that was very influential in culture studies and modern literature. The cyberpunk debate created a more suspicious image of new technologies and their effect on the role of the human being as well as the social life and the society. Gibson's position towards the mind-body-problem, i.e. the relation between mind and body, is examined. An overview is given of possible technologies he describes and how they trigger the breakdown between man and machine as well as between individuals. The paper also sketches the effects of those technologies on social interaction, moral values and the structure of the society.",

Excerpt: The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer is a postcyberpunk novel by Neal Stephenson. It is a bildungsroman focused on a young girl named Nell, and set in a world in which nanotechnology affects all aspects of life. Some main motifs include: education, social class, ethnicity, and the nature of artificial intelligence. The Diamond Age was first published in 1995 by Bantam Books, as a Bantam Spectra hardcover edition. In 1996, it won both the Hugo and Locus Awards, and was shortlisted for the Nebula and other awards, placing it among the most-honored works of science fiction in recent history. A six-hour mini series adapted from the novel is being developed for the Syfy Channel. The protagonist in the story is Nell, a thete (or person without a tribe; equivalent to the lowest working class) living in the Leased Territories, a lowland slum belt on the artificial, diamondoid island of New Chusan, located offshore from the mouth of the Yangtze River, northwest of Shanghai. At age 4, Nell receives a stolen copy of an interactive book, Young Lady's Illustrated Primer: a Propaedeutic Enchiridion in which is told the tale of Princess Nell and her various friends, kin, associates, .",

    "description": "What does the Western city at the end of the twentieth century look like? How did the modern metropolis of congestion and density turn into a posturban or even postsuburban cityscape? What are edge cities and technoburbs? How has the social composition of cities changed in the postwar era? What do gated communities tell us about social fragmentation? Is public space in the contemporary city being privatized and militarized? How can the urban self still be defined? What role does consumer aestheticism have to play in this? These and many more questions are addressed by this uniquely conceived multidisciplinary study. The Urban Condition seeks to interfere in current debates over the future and interpretation of our urban landscapes by reuniting studies of the city as a physical and material phenomenon and as a cultural and mental (arte)fact. The Ghent Urban Studies Team responsible for the writing and editing of this volume is directed by Kristiaan Versluys and Dirk De Meyer at the University of Ghent, Belgium. It is an interdisciplinary research team of young academics that further consists of Kristiaan Borret, Bart Eeckhout, Steven Jacobs, and Bart Keunen. The collective expertise of GUST ranges from architectural theory, urban planning, and art history to philosophy, literary criticism and cultural theory.",

Excerpt: Joe 90 is a late-1960s British science-fiction television series concerning the adventures and exploits of nine-year-old Joe McClaine, who starts a double life as a schoolboy turned spy when his scientist father invents a pioneering machine capable of duplicating and then transferring expert knowledge and experience to another human brain. Equipped with the skills of the foremost academic and military minds, Joe enlists in the World Intelligence Network (WIN), becoming its \"Most Special Agent,\" pursuing the ideal of world peace and saving human life. Created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed at Century 21 Productions, one 30-episode series followed the earlier Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. First screened in the UK between September 1968 and April 1969 on the ATV network, Joe 90 is the sixth and last of the Anderson productions to have been made exclusively using the form of marionette puppetry dubbed \"Supermarionation.\" The final puppet series, The Secret Service, also used this process, but in combination with extensive live-action footage. As in the case of its predecessor, Captain Scarlet, the puppets of Joe 90 are of a more naturally-proportioned design as opposed to the more caricatured appearance of the characters from Thunderbirds. Although not as successful as Century 21's previous puppet efforts, since its inception, Joe 90 has been praised, besides other aspects, for the characterisation of its smaller Supermarionation cast and the accomplishment of its model sets and special effects. Commentators read into Joe 90's spy-fi theme and the selection of a child as...",
